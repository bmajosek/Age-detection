# Age-detection
# Face Detection with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting faces in images. It preprocesses the images by extracting age information and groups them into different age categories. The CNN model is trained on these preprocessed images to detect faces and predict the age of the individuals.

## Usage

- `best_model11.h5` is saved model that has 5.02 mae.
- `train_model`: Script to train your own model.
- `test_model`: Script to test your own model.
- `histograms_with_evaluation` This script has all code

## Dataset

The UTKFace dataset is used for training and testing the model. It contains a large collection of images with annotations for age. This dataset was filtered manually.
